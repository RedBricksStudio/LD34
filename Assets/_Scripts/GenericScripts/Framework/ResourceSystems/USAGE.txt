Resource (Fantasy and Health) mangement system.

Components:

	I_ResourceManager: Common interface for all managers (for now, health and fantasy).
							
						void setMax(float amount);	 //To notify the display
						void setTo(float amount); //To directly set a value
						void increaseIn (float amount); //To increase the current value
						void decreaseIn (float amount); //To decrease the current value
						//Getters
						float getCurValue();
						float getMaxValue();
						
	HealthManager: MonoBehaviour, I_ResourceManager:
					One of the possible implementor classes for I_ResourceManager, this time to 
					manage health. It is a ready-made script that accepts up to one GameObject
					that contains a script that implements I_ResourceDisplay as a display (duh).
					
	FantasyManager: MonoBehaviour, I_ResourceManager:
					The other important implementor classes for I_ResourceManager, this time 
					to manage Fantasy. It can be attached to any object, and accepts a GameObject
					that contains a script that implements I_ResourceDisplay as a display (duh).
					This scipt will decrease the Fantasy amount by a changeable percentage
					each frame (FixedUpdate).

	I_ResourceDisplay : Interface for all displays of a resource. 
						void display(float amount) //pretty obvious
						
Instructions to use the Managers (Scripts):

1.- Attach the HealthManager or FantasyManager to any GameObject desired.
2.- Create a MonoBehaviour Script that implements I_ResourceDisplay
3.- Attach the new Script to the display object.
4.- Pass the display object to the manager.

ISSUES:
- Right now, each health manager only accepts one display, but this can be changed
	if needed, later on.
